# Cubethon-Brackeys-Unity-Study

This project was made as a study to get familiar with the unity engine following the How to make a Video Game by Brackeys.

Two builds were made, both for Windows, the first one is included in the Builds folder as reference, while the second is the final form of this project (for now).

Ideas for future studies include, an endless mode, longer levels and an expanded set of movements and obstacles.
